You memers and your references. Oh boy.
I remember the old days when memes actually used to require effort. Now all you kids do is repeat the same old tired phrases and concepts without a second thought. There's literally no effort placed into your memery. It's just a bunch of empty, meaningless nonsense.
I wish we went back to the old days. Things were so much better then. Real news, real problems in the world, real memes that we had to be CREATIVE enough to come up with and keep, rather than relying on the power of the World Wide Web to carry our ideas everywhere.
I hope you kids get your comeuppance so you will finally understand what a true meme is.
Someday, when the internet breaks down under the weight of its idiocy, you shall finally come to understand what it means to create and maintain real memes. Until then, you'll just be the same old snowflakes that the older generation rightfully complains about.
